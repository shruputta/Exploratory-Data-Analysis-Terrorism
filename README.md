# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Terrorism

Here in this project I have analysed the huge dataset of Terrorism where all the details are being provided

● Performed ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

● As a security/defense analyst, tried to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
